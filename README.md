# CI/CD Pipeline for Flask App on AWS EC2

## 🚀 Overview
This project demonstrates a full CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to deploy a Flask web app to AWS EC2.

## 🧪 How It Works
1. Code pushed to GitHub triggers GitHub Actions.
2. It SSHs into EC2 and deploys the app.
3. App updates live automatically.

## 📂 Files
- app.py
- requirements.txt
- .github/workflows/deploy.yml (will be created in Phase 2)
